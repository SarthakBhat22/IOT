# Smart Parking System
This project uses a combination of distance measurement as well as image processing to provide real time parking updates.

## Overview
This is a simple smart parking system which utilises a combination of ultrasonic sensors as well as a camera (esp32 cam for car detection using opencv) to give users real time updates on the parking spot availability. It also provides a prediction system where users can check the probability of the spot being occupied at a given time on any day of the week.

## Parts Used
1. NodeMCU (ESP8266)
2. Ultrasonic Sensor
3. ESP32 CAM
4. 16x2 LCD Display
